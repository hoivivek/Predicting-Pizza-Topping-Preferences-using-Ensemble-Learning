This study explores the use of machine learning to predict pizza topping preferences based on 
indirect personal interest questions. A dataset of 19 student responses was collected, including 
their preferences for chess pieces, pen types, favorite sports, belief in ghosts, and favorite games. 
Instead of directly asking about their preferred toppings, these factors were used as input features 
for classification. The dataset was preprocessed, split into training and test sets, and multiple 
ensemble learning methods like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting were applied to enhance 
prediction accuracy. 
The study evaluates this ensemble methodâ€™s effectiveness in handling multi-label classification 
and discusses their advantages and limitations. The findings demonstrate the potential of ensemble 
learning in predicting subjective preferences, emphasizing the importance of larger datasets for 
improved generalizability. 
Additionally, the project effectively showcases the power of ensemble learning techniques in 
improving predictive accuracy and robustness in classification tasks. By leveraging multiple base 
models and combining their predictions, the ensemble methods reduced bias and variance, leading 
to more reliable and consistent outputs. Models like Boosting and Stacking exhibited higher 
diversity in outputs, reflecting their sensitivity to subtle variations in input data, while Bagging 
and Voting maintained consistent predictions, indicating stability and reduced variance.
